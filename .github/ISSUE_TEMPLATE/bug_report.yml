      description: In the game's `Logs` folder there will be useful information inside `client-main.log` and `server-main.log`. Please drag and drop those log files here. (For purely visual issues this may not be necessary.) In Multiplayer, we likely need to see the `client-main.log` if you're the player reporting the issue, or the `server-main.log` if you're the server owner. For crashes, `client-crash.log` may be useful. For missing / corrupt worldgen, `server-worldgen.log`. If you re-started the game already after the issue occurred, your older logs are in folder `Logs\Archive`.\
      In the event of a crash please also copy & paste the information from the Crash Reporter screen, paste it between the triple quote marks in the box below.
      placeholder: Paste crash between the triple backticks. Or drag and drop full log files here. Or both...
